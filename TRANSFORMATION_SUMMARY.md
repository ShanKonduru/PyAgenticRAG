### **Key Improvements Over Original**

| Aspect | Original | Enhanced |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Data Sources** | Hardcoded responses | Real file processing + vector search |
| **Error Handling** | None | Comprehensive with recovery |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded | Flexible YAML/env configuration |
| **Interfaces** | Console only | CLI + Web API + Programmatic |
| **Agent Intelligence** | Basic | ReAct reasoning + memory |
| **Performance** | No optimization | Caching + async + monitoring |
| **Production Ready** | No | Yes (logging, health checks, deployment) |
